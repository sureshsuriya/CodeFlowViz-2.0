## Core Features

| Capability | Cockpit Signal |
| --- | --- |
| **Real-time AST Tracing** | Instruments JavaScript syntax trees before execution to capture line-level snapshots as code runs. |
| **Live Variable Inspector** | Surfaces scoped runtime values with type badges, serialized previews, and snapshot-aware inspection. |
| **Playback Scrubber** | Replays execution history so engineers can step into, over, and out of logic flow without rerunning mental simulations. |
| **Tonal Layering “Void” Aesthetic** | Uses high-contrast depth, restrained neon accents, and cockpit-style panels to keep dense telemetry readable. |

## Why CodeFlowViz?

Traditional debuggers are powerful, but they are often optimized for local breakpoints rather than system-level comprehension. CodeFlowViz 2.0 turns execution into a navigable visual timeline, helping teams explain algorithms, review control flow, and reason about state transitions with less context switching.

## The Deployment Story

CodeFlowViz 2.0 is intentionally split into a decoupled monorepo:

- `frontend/` runs the cockpit UI as a Next.js 14 application, optimized for Vercel delivery.
- `backend/` runs the Express execution service in a long-lived Node.js environment, designed for Railway or a comparable host.

This separation solves a practical production constraint: sandboxed code tracing can exceed short serverless execution windows. By moving AST instrumentation and worker-thread execution to Railway while keeping the interface on Vercel, the project preserves a fast frontend deployment path without forcing the execution engine into serverless timeout limits.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Monaco Editor |
| Backend | Node.js, Express, worker threads |
| Execution Engine | AST instrumentation, sandboxed execution, line-level snapshots |
| Deployment | Vercel frontend, Railway backend |
| Initial Language | JavaScript |

## Installation & Setup

### Repository Layout

```text
CodeFlowViz-2.0/
├── frontend/   # Next.js cockpit UI (Vercel target)
├── backend/    # Express + AST execution service (Railway target)
└── package.json
```

The root workspace orchestrates both projects so common scripts (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`) can execute frontend and backend tasks together.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+
- A Vercel project for `frontend/` deployment
- A Railway service, or another long-running Node.js host, for `backend/` deployment

### 1. Clone the monorepo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/CodeFlowViz-2.0.git
cd CodeFlowViz-2.0
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create environment files for local development.

#### Frontend: `frontend/.env.local`

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_EXECUTE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/execute
```

For production on Vercel, point this value to the deployed Railway endpoint:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_EXECUTE_API_URL=https://<your-railway-service>.up.railway.app/api/execute
```

#### Backend: `backend/.env`

```bash
PORT=4000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

For production on Railway, set `CORS_ORIGIN` to your Vercel deployment URL:

```bash
CORS_ORIGIN=https://<your-vercel-project>.vercel.app
```

### 3. Run the full cockpit locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both workspaces:

| Workspace | Default URL | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | `http://localhost:3000` | `npm run dev:frontend` |
| Backend | `http://localhost:4000` | `npm run dev:backend` |

#### 3.1 Build and production preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Use this flow to verify production bundles before deploying to Vercel/Railway.

### 4. Verify the backend health endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "service": "codeflowviz-backend"
}
```

## Deployment

### API Contract (frontend ↔ backend)

The frontend posts source code to the backend execution endpoint:

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Endpoint:** `/api/execute`
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`

Example payload:

```json
{
  "code": "function add(a,b){return a+b}; add(2,3);"
}
```

The backend responds with trace telemetry consumed by the timeline and variable inspector panels.

### Frontend on Vercel

1. Import the repository into Vercel.
2. Set the project root to `frontend/`.
3. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXECUTE_API_URL` with the deployed backend `/api/execute` URL.
4. Deploy.

### Backend on Railway

1. Create a Railway service from the same repository.
2. Set the service root to `backend/`.
3. Add `PORT` if required by your Railway configuration.
4. Add `CORS_ORIGIN` with the Vercel frontend URL.
5. Deploy the Express service.

### Post-deployment checklist

1. Open the deployed frontend URL and run a simple snippet (`const x = 1 + 1`) to verify trace rendering.
2. Confirm backend health is reachable from the public host: `GET /health`.
3. Validate CORS by checking that browser requests to `/api/execute` succeed without preflight errors.
4. Verify backend logs show execution steps and no worker-thread crashes.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Failed to fetch` from frontend**: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXECUTE_API_URL` points to the backend `/api/execute` path and protocol (https/http) matches deployment.
- **CORS errors in browser console**: Verify `CORS_ORIGIN` exactly matches the frontend origin, including scheme and subdomain.
- **Port binding failures on Railway**: Confirm the service uses Railway-provided `PORT` and does not hardcode `4000` in production.
- **No trace events returned**: Inspect backend logs for parser/runtime errors; test the same snippet directly against the API with `curl`.

## Roadmap

- **Multi-language execution** — Python and C++ tracing after the JavaScript execution path is hardened.
- **Advanced Logic Node overlays** — Higher-level control-flow nodes rendered above raw trace events.
- **Trace sharing** — Exportable sessions for code reviews, incident analysis, and teaching.
- **Custom cockpit layouts** — Persisted panels for architecture reviews, demos, and debugging workflows.
- **Expanded sandbox policies** — More granular limits for memory, execution time, and API access.
